    <h1 class="center uppercase">ESSAY THE IDEAL TEACHER</h1>
    <p>Throughout my years studying English, I have had teachers who were all very different from one another. Some
      focused almost entirely on grammar rules, while others tried to make the class more relaxed and connected to real
      situations. Thanks to those experiences, i've been able to understand what teulyhelos me learn and from the re I
      have formes my own idea of what an ideal English teacher should be like One of the most important qualities in
      clear communication. A good english teacher does not make grammar feel like somethings distant or impossible.
      Instead , the explain new topics with simple words and real life examples. </p>
    <p>I remember one teacher who explained
      the present perfect using situation from our daily routine. Thanks to her, a structure that once felt confusing
      suddenly made sense. This showed me how powerful clarity can be when teaching a second language. Another essential
      quality is the ability to build confidence in students. Many learners feel nervous when speaking in english
      especially a the beginning. The ideal teachers understand this and creates a safe environment where mistake are
      seen as parts of the learning process.
    </p>
    <p>I had a teacher who used to say SPEAK FIRST CORRECT LATER that phrase
      helped me overcome my fear of participating and made me realize that progress begins when we stop worrying about
      perfection. (Acosta 2021) highlights the value of learning experiences outside the traditional environment, such
      as exploring language through music, walks, or daily interactions . I appreciate teachers who include song ,
      videos or small real life tasks because they make english feel alive and connected to the world around us. In
      conclusion the ideal teachers communicates clearly , inspires confidence and uses creative strategies that connect
      learning with real life. These qualities do not only help students understand english better they make the
      learning experiences enjoyable, memorable and truly meaningful.</p>
