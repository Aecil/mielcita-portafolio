    <section id="biography">
        <p>My name is Maria Paulina Lora Pacheco. I am from Colombia, and i am currently studying a Bachelor's Degree
            in Foreign Languages with a Emphasis in English at UNAD. I chose this program because i have always been
            interested in learning other languages and how they open professional, cultural, and social opportunities.
            Additionally , i am motivated by the idea of becoming a teacher capable of supporting others in their
            learning process.</p>
        <p>Throughout this term, i have strengthened my skills in English, especially in listening, vocabulary, and
            speaking. Little by little. I have gained more confidence when communicating and i have learned to be more
            consistent in my process, even when difficulties arise. This portafolio brings together the activities
            completed during the course and shows my progress, my effort, and the learning i have built. I am committed
            to continuing to improve an to advancing toward a high level of proficiency and communicate fluently.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, i enjoy writing, reading, and painting, which helps me maintain a balance between my
            studies, responsibilities, and well-being.
