    <p>When I started this term, I had several goals regarding the english language, but honestly, I was not sure how
      much I could improve. Now, looking back, I do feel that I achieved important things. One of the goals I
      accomplished was improving my listening comprehension, because before, I used to get frustrated when I watched
      videos and could not understand them because of how fast people spoke. With constant practice, I noticed that some
      expressions are now familiar to me, and I can watch movies and listen to songs without reading the subtitles, and
      I can also hold a more fluent conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not everything was easy. I struggled to organize my time because I have other responsibilities, and there were
      days when I did not feel like studying due to health issues i've been experiencing. But in order not to fall
      behind or lose progress in my process, I started studying 20 minutes a day, and that consistency helped me a lot.
      I also learned no to push myself too hard when I was exhausted and my body and health could not take any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding resources, what helped me the most were short YouTube videos to practice my listening and pronunciation
      , especially because I can repeat them several times. Duolingo also helped me when my health did not allow much
      effort, but at least it kept me in contact with the language. I realized that the more consistent I am, even with
      small practices, the more i improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think confidence is one of the biggest changes i've had. I still get nervous when speaking, but I do not freeze
      like before. Even the english videos the teacher asks us to make for each activity helped me gain confidence in
      myself and not be afraid of what others might think. I also learned new phrases, new vocabulary, and how I see
      myself as a teacher in a few years, and that makes me feel like i' ve grown on this path. My reading skills have
      also improved a lot and that fills me with excitement.

      For the next term, I want to organize my schedule better and set aside a specific time to practice speaking,
      because that's what I struggle with the most right now. But I feel satisfied with what I have achieved so far.
      Sometimes I feel like i'm improving, and my goals remain important because I want to reach a level where I can
      communicate without fear.</p>
